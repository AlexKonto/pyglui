pyglui
======

Cython powered OpenGL gui.

* Similar to AntTweakBar but truly python compatible. No need for ctyped variables.

* Uses render-to-texture for ulta low cpu use when static.

* Designed to be used with glfw but should run with other window managers as well.

* Requires OpenGL1.1 with extensions for blending and framebufferobjects.

* Uses pyfonstash for rendering text.

* clone with `--recursive` flag


##Install:
python setup.py install
